SW Bench: Contains bechmark file forked from https://github.com/adust09/VOLEitH-bench
VOLEitH-FPGA: HLS source Code.

VOLE-ocity can be used to describe arbitrary computation. To do it, use the circuit generated from solidity file and run it with circuit_paser.py in hls_components by:
python3 circuit_parser.py [your_circuit_file]. It will give input and circuit information that will be used as input streams.
